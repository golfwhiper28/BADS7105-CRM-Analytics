by using supermarket data from Dunnhumby.

In the section 1, users can find the summary detail of data (total spending, total customer and ticket size) by specific shop date.
In the section 2, if users found that the summary detail of data in section 1 has something wrong, they can find more detail in this section. For example, if the total customer in Jun'2008 was decreased from May'2008, users can find what is the reason for the decreasing of total customers in Jun'2008. They were decreased from which store region.
In the section 3, after users found  the reason for the decreasing of total customers in Jun'2008 from which store region. Users can find how to action this problem by using customer segmentation to boost upsell from the customer segments who have high spending in the store region.
